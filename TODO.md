display state object?

What if they press buy product twice - right now they'll get consecutive products for free
What if money is already in the coin return?

Adding single assert statement instead of entire test case
Refactoring, no new tests or functionality
Level of granularity
changing to state object, was that a refactor as well as new functionality?

Made the assumption that the machine has 'infinite coin stock'. I think the expectation is that the machine has a coin stock and if change can't be made for any of the products with the current coin stock it gives the warning.
